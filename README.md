# strip tree implementation
 I realised no one has tried making an implementation of them, so I decided to make one


An output of the actual data structure after a user inputs points on the screen and clicks space:

Here is a video demo that shows strip trees being produced for all sorts of curves with lots of points:

Future developments:

I want to be able to further this into 2d ray tracing and then use that to implement it in my 3d ray tracer for implementing Kajiya's paper on procedural objects and surfaces of revolution: Paper[https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/964967.801137]
